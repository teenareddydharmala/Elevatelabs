# Task-1: Cyber Security Basics & Attack Surface

This repository/document contains a comprehensive deep-dive into the fundamental principles of cybersecurity, designed for high-level technical preparation. It covers the core theoretical frameworks, threat landscapes, and modern vulnerability standards.

## 📂 Deliverables Included

### 1. The CIA Triad Doctrine

An analysis of **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**, mapping these core principles to real-world infrastructure like global banking systems and encrypted social media platforms.

### 2. Threat Actor Taxonomy

A detailed breakdown of adversaries based on both sophistication and ethics:

* **The "Hat" System:** White, Black, Gray, and Red Hat classifications.
* **Actor Profiles:** Script Kiddies, Malicious Insiders, Hacktivists, and Nation-State Actors (APTs).

### 3. Attack Surface & Data Flow Mapping

Technical documentation of how data moves from **User → Application → Server → Database**. This section identifies critical exploitation points such as:

* **Data in Transit:** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) risks.
* **Data at Rest:** Database breach and encryption failure risks.

### 4. OWASP Top 10: 2025 Standard

Integration of the latest **OWASP Top 10: 2025** vulnerability list, including new focus areas like **Software Supply Chain Failures** and **Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions**.

### 5. Advanced Defense Frameworks

Strategic overview of modern defensive methodologies:

* **Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA):** "Never Trust, Always Verify."
* **Defense in Depth:** Layered security controls.
* **The Cyber Kill Chain:** Understanding the 6 stages of an adversarial attack.
